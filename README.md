# Using Remote Sensing to Estimate Adélie Penguin Populations: Effective for Long-Term Trends but Not Annual Variability


## Overview:
We investigated the utility of Very High-Resolution (VHR) imagery for indirect population assessments of Adélie penguins (*Pygoscelis adeliae*) from four Ross Sea colonies: capes Crozier, Bird and Royds, and Inexpressible Island, over the austral summers of 2009-2021. We extracted the area of guano from VHR imagery and relate it to the number of breeding pairs of Adélie penguin and colony spatial paramters. 
 Three main questions were addressed: 

  1) How does the number of breeding pairs and other topographic features influence the area of guano extracted from VHR imagery?

  2) How well does our model predict the relationship between the number of breeding pairs and the area of guano in general and at a ‘new’ colony?

  3) What percent change in breeding pairs between years will result in a sufficiently large change in guano area that we can be confident that we can detect colony size change remotely? In other words, how sensitive is observing guano area for detecting population change?
