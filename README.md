# Advancing efficiencies in remote sensing of Ross Sea Adélie penguin populations


## Overview:
[add overview]
 Three main questions were addressed: 

  1) What factors influence the area of guano extracted from VHR imagery in any given year, and therefore the ability to predict the number of breeding pairs using       guano area?

  2) How well does our model predict the relationship between the number of breeding pairs and the area of guano in general and at a ‘new’ colony?

  3) What percent change in breeding pairs between years will result in a sufficiently large change in guano area that we can be confident that colony change has        actually occurred? In other words, how sensitive is observing guano area for detecting population change?

## Contains:
This repository contains the R code and data required for completing the analysis in Strang et al. in prep.
