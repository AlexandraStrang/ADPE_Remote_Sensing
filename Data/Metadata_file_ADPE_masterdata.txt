Purpose: Using the area of guano as a population index from satellite imagery to monitor four Adélie penguin colonies in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, between the austral summers of 2009-2021. 

Column names and description:
The column name is found in row one of each column.
Colony: The given name of the Adélie penguin colony.
Site_ID: The four digit colony code.
Year: The Adélie penguin breeding season that the satellite imagery is from; we use the initial year of the beginning of the austral summer.
Image_date: The date of when the satellite image was taken in yyyymmdd format.
Guano_area: The area of gunao in metres squared.
BP: The number of breeding pairs of Adélie penguins obtained via aerial survey (Lyver et al. 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091188)
PAR: The average perimeter-area-ratio (PAR) of the guano area at each colony.
SD_PAR: The standard deviation of the average perimeter-area-ratio (PAR) of the guano area at each colony.
Slope: The average slope (degrees) of the guano area terrain at each colony.
SD_Slope: The standard deviation of the average slope (degrees) of the terrain at each colony.
Aspect: The average aspect (degrees) of the guano area terrain at each colony.
SD_Aspect: The standard deviation of the average aspect (degrees) of the guano area terrain at each colony.
